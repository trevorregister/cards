I started off just wanting to simulate War, but then thought it'd be more interesting to be more abstract with cards.py so that other card games
could be modeled. I wanted to model what you could do with cards (i.e., cards.py), then use that to code rules for individual games.

Cards are objects with a suit and a value, akin to a standard playing card. Piles are collections of cards, abstracted from the idea of things like a hand, 
a discard pile, a draw pile, etc. Each Card is an entry in a Pile's contents array.

Piles are owned by Owners and are contained within an Owner's belongings. An Owner's belongings' is a dictionary where each key:value pair is the name of a Pile and the 
Pile object, respectively. 

Owners are intended to be both individual players as well as something like the game board. In that instance, the board could own the deck.
